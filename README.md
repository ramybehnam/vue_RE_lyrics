# re_lyrics

Developer
- Ramy Behnam

The application
-   The application is a website where you can search for lyrics by its song name and artist. A song lyric can be saved and deleted to the local storage. The lyrics saved can be found in the “My List” page. The API that is being used for the application is THENAME.

Choice of technology
-   The project, RELyrics, is build with Vue.js. Vue.js was chosen over React.js because of its easy learning curve and good documentation [1]. React.js might be the second most popular framework [1] but Vue.js is growing in popularity and in usage. 

-   Vue.js is for the group a new framework to work with. React.js has been tackled during the course, Cross-platform Applications with Web Technologies at Malmö University. Therefore Vue.js was also chosen over React.js so that new challenges and new concepts could be learned.
